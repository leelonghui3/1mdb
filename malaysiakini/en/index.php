				<p>The seizure of The Equanimity luxury yacht in Bali, Indonesia, in late February this year, has once again brought the civil forfeiture suits by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) into the spotlight.</p>
				<p>The DOJ had filed a series of the forfeiture suits in 2016 and 2017, seeking to seize assets worth nearly US$1.7 billion allegedly acquired using money siphoned off from the Malaysian fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).</p>
				<p>According to the DOJ, 1MDB officials and their associates had embezzled US$4.5 billion between 2009 and 2014, which was allegedly laundered through the global financial systems including the US. It is the most extensive action brought under its Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. The department said that the money was used for personal gain.</p>
				<p>They include purchasing luxury properties, artworks, a private jet, jewellery, funding movie production company which produced movies like "The Wolf of Wall Street". The Equanimity, which is said to belong to Malaysian businessperson Jho Low, was one of the assets on the list.</p>
				<p>Jho Low, whose full name is Low Taek Jho, was portrayed as the mastermind of the money laundering scheme in the DOJ lawsuit. Several other persons were named in the lawsuits, including Jho Low’s friend Riza Aziz, who is also the stepson of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak, several 1MDB officers, and an unnamed "Malaysian Official 1", who was said to be Najib himself.</p>
				<p>Several celebrities, including Hollywood actor Leonardo Dicaprio and model Miranda Kerr were dragged into the matter.</p>
				<p>The lawsuits had categorised the money-laundering processes over the five-year period into four phases, namely the "Good Star phase", "Aabar BVI phase", "Tanore phase" and "Options Buyback phase".</p>
				<p>The lawsuits consist several hundred pages long and provide a blow-by-blow account of the complex series of transaction. This article will break down the complexities of the suits and walk readers through the money trail.</p>

						<div id="goodstar-1" class="uk-block">
							<p>According to the DOJ, more than US$1 billion was fraudulently diverted from 1MDB in September 2009, soon after its creation.</p>
							<p>Between 2009 and 2011, 1MDB had entered a joint-venture agreement with PetroSaudi International (PSI), a private Saudi oil extraction company.</p>
							<p>The joint venture (1MDB-PSI) aimed to exploit energy concessions PSI purportedly owned in Turkmenistan and Argentina.</p>
							<p>Under the agreement, 1MDB had invested US$1 billion cash in the joint venture in exchange for a 40 percent equity interest. However, only US$300 million went into the joint venture’s account while the remaining US$700 million went to Good Star Limited, a company belonging to Jho Low.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="svg/goodstar/goodstar-1.svg" alt="" width="100%">
							</figure>
							<p>Two officials, who were named by DOJ as 1MDB Officer 1 and 2, had misrepresented to banks that Good Star was a subsidiary of PSI. 1MDB’s board of director was told that the US$700 million was used to settle the debt owed by the joint venture to PSI.</p>
							<p>Although Jho Low had no official position in 1MDB, he was an adviser in the formation of 1MDB’s predecessor, the Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA). The investment arm of Terengganu, a Malaysian state, was taken over by the federal government and renamed as 1MDB in early 2009.</p>
							<p>Jho Low built his relationship with Najib’s family through Riza, whom he has known since his days in university.</p>
						</div>
						<hr>
						<div id="goodstar-2" class="uk-block">
							<p>In June 2010, 1MDB had decided to dispose of its 40 percent equity interest in the joint venture. Instead of taking cash for the stake sale, 1MDB settled on US$1.2 billion in debt notes, which included purported profits.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="svg/goodstar/goodstar-2.svg" alt="" width="100%">
							</figure>
		
							<p>Three months later, 1MDB-PSI joint venture received an additional loan of US$500 million from 1MDB. In May 2011, 1MDB had issued an extra US$330 million credit to the joint venture, but the money ended up in Good Star’s account.</p>
						</div>
						<hr>
						<div id="goodstar-3" class="uk-block">
							<p>As of 25 Oct 2011, a total of US$1.03 billion of 1MDB’s funds was diverted to Good Star. Low used US$35 million of it to purchase the Stratton Penthouse and the Stratton Flat in London, while diverted US$10,173,104 for the production of the movie The Wolf of Wall Street.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="svg/goodstar/goodstar-3.svg" alt="" width="100%">
							</figure>
							<p>Another beneficiary was PSI co-founder Tarek Obaid who used the money to acquire shares of a software engineering company Palantir Technologies.</p>
							<p>Some of the money was distributed to 1MDB Officer 1, through an individual called Eric Tan.</p>

							<p>Jho Low tried to mask the acquisition of assets using the ill-gotten funds in Good Star by going through law firms as well as a web of companies and his father.</p>
							<p>Between 21 Oct 2009 and 13 Oct 2010, more than US$368 million in 11 wires was moved from Good Star to an Interest on Lawyer Account held by law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP (Shearman IOLA) in the United States.</p>
							<p>Subsequently, the money was used to purchase luxury properties, a hotel and a private jet. They included the L'Ermitage Hotel, a Hillcrest property in Beverly Hill, a Park Laurel Condominium unit, and a Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft worth millions of US dollars respectively.</p>

							<p>The DOJ also found that Jho Low purchased assets using his father’s bank account, Larry.</p>
							<p>Good Star transferred approximately US$508 million to Abu Dhabi-Kuwait-Malaysia Investment Corporation (ADKMIC) between 28 June 2011 and 4 Sept 2013. Low owned ADKMIC for money laundering, DOJ claimed. Good Star’s account was closed on 5 Sept 2013 after the transactions.</p>
							<p>Following this, ADKMIC transferred about US$327 million to Larry in three tranches in 2011 and 2012. Larry then wired the funds to an account in the name of Selune Ltd (US$30 million) and Jho Low (US$268 million) respectively.</p>
							<p>Selune subsequently wired US$27 million to Shearman IOLA. The money was used as part of the funds to purchase Time Warner Penthouse.</p>

						<div id="goodstar-9" class="uk-block">
							<p>Meanwhile, Jho Low used the money from Larry to acquire shares in EMI Music Publishing Group America Holdings Inc (EMI) with US$106,666,667 and transferred US$146,246,670 to Selune. US$36,246,670 of the US$146,246,670 was proceeds of the sale of Qentas Townhouse to Riza in <a href="#aabarbvi" data-uk-smooth-scroll="{top:50}">Aabar-BVI phase</a>.</p>
							<figure>
								<img src="svg/goodstar/goodstar-9.svg" alt="" width="100%">

							<p>In acquiring stakes in EMI, the DOJ noted that Low represented that family resources were a significant source of his wealth.</p>

						<hr>
						<div id="goodstar-10" class="uk-block">
							<blockquote>
								<p class="uk-text-large">"By funnelling money through his father’s account for a brief period of time, LOW created the appearance that funds in his personal account, which were used to acquire an interest in EMI Partner A, came from his father rather than from Good Star or ADKMIC."</p>
								<small>The DOJ</small>
							</blockquote>
							<br>
							<p>Selune Ltd then passed on the funds to Shearman IOLA for the purchase of a Time Warner Penthouse. Jho Low and Selune Ltd collectively sent US$51,682,800 to an US-based law firm DLA Piper for the purchase of the Oriole Mansion, the Greene Condominium and to acquire interest in Viceroy Hotel Group with the funds from Shearman IOLA.</p>

							<p>The money laundering methods used in Options Buyback phase are similar to the previous stages, but there was one key difference. A significant amount of the Deutsche Bank loan was also used to cover the "hole" in 1MDB’s subsidiary Brazen Sky Limited.</p>
							<p>It can be traced back to the money trail in <a href="#goodstar" data-uk-smooth-scroll="{top:50}">Good Star phase</a> in 2009, where 1MDB had supposedly invested US$1.83 billion to the 1MDB-PSI joint venture but US$1.03 billion of it was allegedly siphoned for the personal benefit of Jho Low and his associates.</p>
							<p>On Oct 10, 2015, 1MDB claimed that Brazen Sky was holding a US$2.318 billion in "fund units" which was redeemed from the joint venture. 1MDB claimed the "fund units" comprised its initial US$1.83 billion investment which was redeemed on top of a US$488 million profit.</p>
							<p>The DOJ claimed the "fund units" managed by little-known Bridge Partners Investment Management Limited, were "relatively worthless".</p>
							<p>Two days after Aabar-Seychelles received US$233 million of a US$975 million loan from Deutsche Bank intended for 1MDB, it transferred US$111 million to Lambasa Global Opportunity Fund.</p>
							<p>Lambasa’s function was similar to Enterprise and Cisenique, which was to function as a pass-through entity.</p>
							<p>Almost immediately after that, Lambasa passed about US$110 million to Bridge Global Fund. A few days later, Bridge Global Fund transferred approximately US$110 million to Brazen Sky as "redemption" of fund units.</p>
							<p>It was followed by Brazen Sky sending approximately US$94 million to 1MDB Global Investments Limited, another subsidiary of 1MDB.</p>
							<blockquote class="uk-text-large uk-margin">
								<p>"The purpose of this unnecessarily complicated funds flow was to create the appearance that fund units in the Brazen Sky Account were being redeemed for cash and being paid forward to 1MDB, thereby fraudulently disguising the fact that the fund units were illiquid and relatively worthless."</p>
								<small>The DOJ</small>
							</blockquote>
							<p>The same pattern of fund flows was repeated on Sept 29, 2014, after Aabar-Seychelles received the second tranche of loan proceeds from Deutsche Bank. This time, the majority of the funds that transited through Brazen Sky were returned to Aabar-Seychelles rather than being retained by 1MDB Global Investments. The cycle was repeated for another five times.</p>
							<blockquote class="uk-text-large uk-margin">
								<p>"This allowed the funds to be recycled again and again through the same circle of entities, thereby creating the appearance of multiple ‘redemptions’ using the same pool of money."</p>
								<small>The DOJ</small>
							</blockquote>
							<p>By the end of November 2014, proceeds from the first tranche of the loan had passed through Brazen Sky once and the second tranche of the loan had passed through Brazen Sky six times. Finally, it appeared as if Brazen Sky had redeemed US$1.412 billion from its "fund units".</p>

							<p>Nevertheless, the DOJ pointed that the movement of funds had created difficulty for 1MDB as it had used the "fund units" as collateral for the bank loan, which condition included that Brazen Sky cannot transfer the "units" out without the bank’s approval.</p>
							<p>As such, 1MDB had breached the loan agreement. prompting Deutsche Bank to demand early repayment of the US$975 million loan after it had found out the deceit in May 2015.</p>
							<p>The Malaysian government announced the restructuring plan in the same month which paved the way for IPIC to come in with US$1 billion to help 1MDB for the loan repayment in exchange for certain assets.</p>
							<p>A year later in April 2016, the white knight deal soured as IPIC argued that 1MDB and the Ministry of Finance did not meet some of their payment obligations, which 1MDB and the ministry had vehemently denied. As a result, the issue turned into an arbitration case.</p>
							<p>In April 2017, both IPIC and 1MDB had reached a settlement over the matter. 1MDB agreed to pay IPIC US$1.2 billion and both party would discuss the payments made by 1MDB to "certain entities", which were believed referring to Aabar-BVI and Aabar-Seychelles. The Malaysian government had paid US$1.2 billion to IPIC end of last year.</p>

				<p>Several banks in Switzerland and Singapore were fined and ordered close by the authorities. Among others, the Swiss government will absorb CHF95 million (approximately US$100 million) from 1MDB-linked funds seized from several banks as there are no claimants.</p>
				<p>Before that in Jan 2017, Jho Low’s family also won a court action in New Zealand to transferred several assets to a new trustee, in a bit to protect the assets from being seized by the DOJ.</p>
				<p>The assets, worth US$256 million, include the Bombardier Jet, the Hillcrest property in Beverly Hills and three other properties.</p>
				<p>The DOJ <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/391564" target="_blank">applied to stay its civil forfeiture suits</a> in Aug last year, pending an ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI.</p>
				<p>It was reported that Republican donor <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-ally-was-in-talks-to-earn-millions-in-effort-to-end-1mdb-probe-in-u-s-1519919321" target="_blank">Elliott Broidy</a>, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was trying to negotiate a deal with Jho Low to drop the investigation.</p>
				<p>The 1MDB probe in Malaysia is stalled with police claming that there had been no new developments. The inspector-general of police Mohamed Fuzi Harun claimed police had determined <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/414814" target="_blank">there was nothing to link Jho Low with 1MDB</a>.</p>
				<p>The 1MDB issue has become a hot potato for the Malaysian government since the last general election in 2013. The opposition is expected to leverage on this in its campaign to unseat Najib and the ruling coalition in the coming general election, which is widely speculated to be held in late April or early May this year.</p>
				<p>Any new developments on the 1MDB case on the global front, coupled with inaction locally, will harm the Barisan Nasional’s standing in the national polls.</p>
