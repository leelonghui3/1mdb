    <p>The seizure of The Equanimity luxury yacht in Bali, Indonesia, in late February this year, has once again brought the civil forfeiture suits by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in the spotlight.</p>

    <p>The DOJ had filed a series of the forfeiture suits in 2016 and 2017, seeking to seize assets worth nearly US$1.7 billion that purchased with the money that allegedly syphoned off from the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad
      (1MDB).
    </p>

    <p>According to the DOJ, 1MDB officials and their associates had embezzled US$4.5 billion between 2009 and 2014 which went through the US financial system and other banks in several countries. It is the most extensive action brought under its Kleptocracy
      Asset Recovery Initiative.</p>

    <p>“1MDB was created by the Malaysian government to promote economic development through international partnerships and foreign direct investment, with the ultimate goal of improving the well-being of the Malaysian people.</p>

    <p>“Unfortunately, a number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account,” said the then US Attorney General Loretta Lynch when she announced the civil complaints on 20 July 2016.</p>

    <p>The department said that the money was used for personal gain. They include purchasing luxury properties, drawings, private jet, jewellery, funding the production of the movie “The Wolf of Wall Street”. The Equanimity, which is said to belong to Malaysian
      businessperson Jho Low, is one of the assets on the list.</p>

    <p>Jho Low, whose full name is Low Taek Jho, was portrayed as the mastermind of the money laundering scheme in the DOJ lawsuit. Several other persons were named in the lawsuits, including Jho Low’s friend Riza Aziz, who is also the stepson of Malaysian
      Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak, several 1MDB officers, Hollywood actor Leonardo Dicaprio, model Miranda Kerr, and an unnamed “Malaysian Official 1”, who was said to be Najib himself.</p>

    <p>The lawsuits had categorised the money-laundering processes over the five-year period into four phases, namely the “Good Star phase”, “Aabar BVI phase”, “Tanore phase” and “Options Buyback phase”, detailing the money trail involving, among others,
      Jho Low and Riza.</p>

    <p>The lawsuits consist several hundred pages long and provide a blow-by-blow account of the complex series of transaction. This article will break the lawsuits down to the four phases and walk the readers through the money trail for a better understanding
      of the issue.</p>

      <h1>Good Star Phase</h1>

      <p>According to the DOJ, more than US$1 billion was fraudulently diverted from 1MDB in September 2009, soon after its creation.</p>

      <p>Between 2009 and 2011, 1MDB had entered a joint-venture agreement with PetroSaudi International (PSI), a private Saudi oil extraction company.</p>

      <p>The joint venture (1MDB-PSI) aimed to exploit certain energy concessions PSI purportedly owned located in Turkmenistan and Argentina.</p>

      <p>Under the agreement, 1MDB had invested US$1 billion cash in the joint venture in exchange for a 40 percent equity interest. However, only US$300 million went into the joint venture’s account while the remaining US$700 million went to Good Star Limited, a company belonged to Jho Low.</p>

      <p>Two officials at 1MDB, who were named by DOJ as 1MDB Officer 1 and 2, had misrepresented to banks that Good Star was a subsidiary of PSI. 1MDB’s board of director was told that the US$700 million was used to settle the debt owed by the joint venture to PSI.</p>

      <p>Although Jho Low had no official position in 1MDB, he was the adviser to the formation of 1MDB’s predecessor, the Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA). The investment arm of the Terengganu state was taken over by the Malaysian federal government from the state government and renamed as 1MDB in early 2009.</p>

      <p>Jho Low has a good relationship with Najib’s family as he is a good friend of premiere’s stepson Riza, whom he has known since his days in university.</p>

      <p>In June 2010, the joint venture project turned sour, and 1MDB had decided to dispose of its 40 percent equity interest in the joint venture. However, it did not take back the money instead it sold its share back to the joint venture. The joint venture gave 1MDB US$1.2 billion in debt notes. 1MDB agreed to provide the joint venture with an additional loan up to US$1.5 billion.</p>

      <p>Three months later, 1MDB-PSI joint venture received an additional loan of US$500 million from 1MDB. In May 2011, 1MDB had issued an extra US$330 million credit to the joint venture, but the money ended up in Good Star’s account.</p>

      <p>As of 25 Oct 2011, a total of US$1.03 billion originated from 1MDB was transferred to Good Star. Some of the money was sent to 1MDB Officer 1 through intermediaries and to PSI co-founder Tarek Obaid for the acquisition of the shares of a software engineering company Palantir Technologies.</p>

      <p>Malaysian Official 1 (MO1) received US$20 million in this phase too. The DOJ described MO1 as a “high-ranking official in the Malaysian government who also held a position of authority with 1MDB”.</p>

      <p>Malaysian minister Abdul Rahman Dahlan had said that MO1 is Najib, according to his interview with BBC in 2016. Najib had repeatedly denied he had involved in any wrongdoing in the 1MDB saga.</p>

      <p>Jho Low had used the funds in Good Star to purchase several assets through law firms, entities and even his father.</p>

      <p>Between 21 Oct 2009 and 13 Oct 2010, more than US$368 million in 11 wires was moved from Good Star to an Interest on Lawyer Account held by law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP (Shearman IOLA) in the United States.</p>

      <p>Subsequently, the money was used to purchase luxury properties, hotel and private jet. They included L'Ermitage Hotel, a Hillcrest property in Beverly Hill, a Park Laurel Condominium unit, and a Bombardier Global 5000 aircraft which worth millions of US dollars respectively.</p>

      <p>Shearman IOLA also received funds from Selune Ltd, which owned by Jho Low for the abovementioned purchases.</p>

      <p>The department also found that Jho Low purchased assets using bank account owned by his father, Larry Low.</p>

      <p>Good Star had also transferred approximately US$508 million to Abu Dhabi-Kuwait-Malaysia Investment Corporation (ADKMIC) between 28 June 2011 and 4 Sept 2013. Low owned ADKMIC for money laundering, DOJ claimed. Good Star’s account was closed on 5 Sept 2013 after the transactions.</p>

      <p>Following this, ADKMIC transferred about US$327 million to Larry Low in three tranches in 2011 and 2012. Larry Low then wire the funds to Selune Ltd and Jho Low respectively.</p>

      <p>Jho Low then use the money from Larry Low to acquire shares in EMI Music Publishing Group America Holdings Inc (EMI) with US$106,666,667 and transferred US$252,913,337 to Selune Ltd.</p>

      <p>In the acquisition of the interests in EMI, the DOJ noted that Low represented that family resources were a significant source of his wealth.</p>

      <p>“By funnelling money through his father’s account for a brief period of time, LOW created the appearance that funds in his personal account, which were used to acquire an interest in EMI Partner A, came from his father rather than from Good Star or ADKMIC,” said the DOJ.</p>

      <p>Selune Ltd then passed on the funds to Shearman IOLA for the purchase of Time Warner Penthouse. Jho Low and Selune Ltd had collectively sent US$51,682,800 to an US-based law firm DLA Piper for the purchase of the Oriole Mansion, the Greene Condominium and to acquire the interest in Viceroy Hotel Group with the funds from Shearman IOLA. </p>

      <h1>Aabar-BVI Phase</h1>

      <p>1MDB raised US$3.5 billion in two separate bond offerings to acquire certain energy assets in Malaysia but the substantial portion of the proceeds - approximately US$1.367 billion - was misappropriated.</p>

      <p>The bonds were guaranteed by both 1MDB and International Petroleum Investments Company (IPIC), an investment entity owned by Abu Dhabi government.</p>

      <p>In exchange, 1MDB agreed to provide IPIC’s subsidiary Aabar Investments PJS (Aabar) options to acquire 49 percent interest in an energy asset.</p>

      <p>1MDB received the proceeds of each of the bond issues in 2012, but the profits were almost immediately transferred to an entity called Aabar Investments PJS Limited (Aabar-BVI), a British Virgin Islands-registered corporation.</p>

      <p>Aabar-BVI bore a similar name to the legitimate Aabar, but there was no affiliation between Aabar and Aabar-BVI. IPIC had denied that neither Aabar and itself have any links to Aabar-BVI. 1MDB had later conceded that 1MDB might be a “victim of fraud”.</p>

      <p>At the time, Khadem Abdulla al-Qubaisi was the managing director of IPIC and the chairperson of Aabar. Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny was the CEO of Aabar. However, both of them were also the director of Aabar-BVI.</p>

      <p>“Khadem and Mohamed opened the account at BSI Bank in Lugano in the name of Aabar-BVI and used the account to facilitate the diversion of funds from 1MDB. (Jho) Low was also integrally involved in setting up the Aabar-BVI Swiss Account and in arranging for the fraudulent transfer of $1.367 billion from 1MDB to the Aabar-BVI Swiss Account,” the DOJ document read.</p>

      <p>A total of US$1.092 billion diverted through Aabar-BVI and was transferred to Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners (Blackstone) which is owned by an individual called Eric Tan.</p>

      <p>Two companies owned by Mohamed - Rayan Inc and MB Consulting LLC - received US$11.6 million and US$55 million from Blackstone respectively, while Vasco Investment owned by Khadem got US$472,750,000, which he later used to purchase Walker Tower Penthouse, Laurel Beverly Hills Mansion and a Hillcrest property.</p>

      <p>MO1 also received US$30 million from Blackstone. The former 1MDB general counsel and executive director of group strategy Jasmine Loo got US$5 million which she used to purchase a residential unit in One Madison Park Condominium.</p>

      <p>Another US$238 million from Aabar-BVI was wired to Red Granite Capital, an entity founded by Riza Shahriz Abdul Aziz. Riza is the stepson of Najib as described by the DOJ that Riza is a relative of MO1 and a friend of Jho Low.</p>

      <p>Riza then channelled the money to film production company Red Granite Pictures to produce movie The Wolf of Wall Street, Daddy’s Home and Dumb and Dumber To.</p>

      <p>The production of The Wolf of Wall Street had received over US$60 million in Good Star phase and Aabar-BVI phase. Nevertheless, Red Granite Pictures had reached a settlement with the US government to the tune of US$60 million, and Riza will only draw a limited salary to cover his health insurance until the full settlement amount is paid.</p>

      <p>A sum of US$94.3 million was sent to Shearman IOLA to acquire several luxury properties. In particular, Riza spent US$17.5 million and US$33.5 million to buy a Hillcrest property and Park Laurel Condominium from Jho Low, who had purchased the properties in Good Star phase.</p>

      <p>Riza also spent US$4,289,760 from Red Granite Capital for movie posters.</p>

      <p>“The walls of the Park Laurel Condominium, where Riza lived, are covered in movie posters that Riza acquired using funds from Aabar-BVI. Riza also gave away several posters as gifts, including to (Red Granite Picture co-founder Joey) McFarland, (Hollywood actor Leonardo) DiCaprio, and the director of ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’,” said the DOJ.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Blackstone also wired a whopping US$321.3 million to Alsen Chance Holdings Limited. Alsen Chance wired US$11 million to Venetian Resort-Hotel-Casino and that later deposited into Jho Low’s account to settle a gambling debt.</p>

      <p>“On or about July 15, 2012, Jho Low withdrew an aggregate cash amount of US$1,150,090 at the Venetian Casino: US$500,000 as a withdrawal of deposit, and US$650,090 as the redemption of casino chips and other gaming instruments.</p>

      <p>“Several individuals gambled with Jho Low on this occasion, using his account. These individuals included Riza; McFarland; DiCaprio; and the 1MDB-SRC Officer, who was the former chief investment officer of 1MDB and was at the time the CEO of another Ministry of Finance vehicle called SRC International,” the DOJ noted.</p>

      <p>Jho Low used the same modus operandi of creating the impression that he was using his family wealth to acquire interests in Electrum Group, a private equity firm in the United States, and purchase diamond Ring & earrings worth US$2,842,475 to his mother, Evelyn Goh. It was done by transferring the money from Alsen Chance through his father account to himself.</p>

      <p>After receiving US$275.5 million from Alsen Chance, Good Star had wired US$20.75 million to Khadem’s Vasco Investments.</p>
